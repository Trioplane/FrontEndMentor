## My process

I planned the structure and built it on HTML, then did the styles on CSS

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Variables
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [MDN Web Docs](https://developer.mozilla.org) - This website has all the elements and methods and properties you can find in HTML CSS JS, this helped me a lot since I sometimes forget how to use a thing properly
